# Air Conditioning Connector for Jet on Boylston Apartments (Seattle)

## Purpose
Part for connecting air conditioning hose to the dedicated hole in the wall of the Jet on Boylston apartments in Seattle.
This wall connection is non-standard, meaning it is hard/impossible to find a connector into the wall.
This specific part is for a [Black + Decker BPACT10WT](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DLPUWG2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) portable AC unit, but likely works with other AC hoses as well.
Please see this [drawing](drawing_connector_rev_July_2.pdf) for dimensions to see if it will work with your AC hose.

## Manufacturing
This part lends itself well for 3D printing (use the [STL file](connector_rev_Jul_2.STL) for that).
Material cost should be a few dollars.
Ordering the part online (for instance [here](https://www.xometry.com)) is more on the order of $40-$50, but you can probably find it cheaper somewhere as well.
These parts can get warm (they are venting hot air), so to be safe, make sure to select a material that can handle that (like PETG or Nylon).
I had mine printed in PETG on a [Prusa i3](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html).

## Modifying
You are free to modify this part, the [STP file](connector_rev_July_2.stp) can be used for that.
